# Practicing Front End Snippets

This repo is dedicated to sharing the front-end code snippets that I've found from others. When I find a cool front-end feature with code on social media, I will take the time to copy it out and try to understand what all of the pieces are doing to make that snippet work! 

## Disclaimer

Most of this work is _not_ my own! In each file of the source code is a direct attribution to the developer profile that designed the code.

## How Do I View These?

Each folder contains a small front end feature designed to be viewed in your browser. I've included pull requests for each with a picture or video of the output. You can also fork the repo and run a live server from each folder to view its index.html file.

## Why Are You Doing This?

I often run into small fragments of web design that I have _no_ idea how to do. And there are so many developers willing to share their source code with the world! With each fragment, I learn a little more about what is possible. I want to keep this collection here to reference as I build my own projects and websites! I hope that you can also benefit from it as well!
